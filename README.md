# PictureColorization (Black and White to Color Image Converter)

## Overview
This project aims to provide a simple and intuitive solution for converting black and white images to color images using deep learning techniques. The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on a dataset of colored images to generate realistic colorizations of grayscale input images.

## Features
- **Image Conversion**: Convert black and white images to color images.
- **User Interface**: Utilizes Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.
- **Fast Processing**: Efficient processing of images for quick results.
- **Customizable Options**: Adjustable parameters for fine-tuning the colorization process.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/BlackWhite-to-Color.git](https://github.com/atulmaybe/PictureColorization.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd PictureColorization
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Access the application through your web browser at the provided URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

3. Upload a black and white image using the provided interface.

4. Wait for the model to process the image and generate the colorized version.

5. Optionally, adjust any parameters provided to fine-tune the colorization process.

6. Download the colorized image once processing is complete.

## Model Details
The colorization model is built using Python and deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It employs a CNN architecture trained on a diverse dataset of colored images to learn meaningful color representations and apply them to grayscale images effectively.
